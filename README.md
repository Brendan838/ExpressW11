# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description

This application was created for my Week 11 U of MN bootcamp homework. The front end code was supplied for a Note Taking application, and I created a server and json database via node and express to get, post, and delete information via api. The server was deployed to heroku. [Click here to view the live deployment.](https://expressw11.herokuapp.com/)
